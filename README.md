# Portfolio

Here are some side projects I care about 🙂, simply laid down in a gist #KISS #simplicity. Also see [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/?piotr-yuxuan). Most of my projects are visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan). In case you'd like to get in touch, go on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PiotrYuxuan).

This is where I would put some of my training exercises when the problems looks peculiarly fun, and interesting to solve. Algorithmic questions asked in coding interviews will probably be similar to code here.

Nevertheless I shall add I'm always a bit disappointed by coding interviews where the job seeker is only given some riddles to solve quickly. It's a microscopic part of amy daily engineering work which ought to involve reasoning about the long-term technical vision to serve the business of the company, being cognizant about the platform observability, resilience, and robustness, and friendly rubbing shoulders with other team mates.

Apache Avro is a way to serialize data in binary according to some schema which describes the data shapes from (nested) primitive types. I figured out it would be pretty useful to generate random sample of Avro messages corresponding to a schema. Using clojure.spec, test.check, and some Java interop, code turns out to be pretty concise.

This is an example of emerging design, exemplifying Eisenhower sentence: « plans are useless, but planning is indispensable ». I had a strong idea of what I need, I knew Clojure protocol would a suitable implementation choice, but I started from a white sheet and let the code click flow itself in the simplest way while I iteratively added new features and constraints.

Not the whole Apache Avro spec is implemented but I aim at making this side project useful for my main employer usecase.

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/piotr-yuxuan/nabab)](https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan/nabab/issues)

- Early example of emerging design with a focus on simplicity and decomplection. I chose name Nabab in order to keep remembering me I don't want an abstraction above core.async, merely a side tooling.
- Example of litterate programming with Emacs.
- Inspiration from this project come from Prismatic plumbing graph,
  and timely dataflow.

## Next Phone (from Aug 2018)

Older [source](https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan/choose-a-new-phone) and [website](https://piotr-yuxuan.github.io/choose-a-new-phone) hosted on GitHub, more recent [source](https://gitlab.com/next-phone/next-phone.gitlab.io) and [website](https://next-ph.one) hosted on GitLab.

- Strong accent on UX: explain interface behaviour in full, simple language so user can't be lost and understand as much as possible what he's doing.
- For the Greater Cause ;-) try to be useful for LineageOS, a floss Android
- Host, deploy from GitLab with GitLab CI
- Clojure, core.async, dataflow programming (something akin timely-dataflow in Rust), lein figwheel then shadow-cljs, React 16.1, Material UI
- Configure DNS, domain, deployment pipeline, and everything all from the ground up.

Get a reproductible and declarative configuration of the programs I use for my daily life and document their use.

It's quite clear that any sharing of personal dot files contains a risk of leaking secrets or confidential data. To mitigate this risk I've copied a private repo, deleted its history, then committed a carefully current state. Obviouly it's pretty outdated now and I don't plan to update the public version any soon.

Hint: this repository makes heavy use of Emacs litterate programming capabilities (with org-mode and babel). Hence, please forgive broken links in the README. They would perfectly work when read in Emacs, but GitHub org-mode parser can't handle them properly.

## PE2C, young three-person company website (from Mar 2018)

https://github.com/pe2c/pe2c.github.io

Corporate showcase website for a young, local three-person company.

I tried my best to stick to the precise ideas the stakeholders had about design ^^ I'm here to serve them, not to change their minds, so I complied to their wishes. However, as for classified matter, I do endorse neither reject any material about this site.

## Le mille pattes faisait un mille pièces (Oct 2017)

https://piotr-yuxuan.github.io/1111101000-pieces/index.html

(The centipede was making a hundred-piece puzzle)

Let's be honnest and acknowledge it's not an very interesting project from a technical viewpoint. I worked with a friend of mine with is an artist. He was interested in studying the relation of human vision to disorder.

## Illegal activity (from Aug 2017)

https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan/illegal-activity

Are you using the same laptop at home and at work? if you're company policies forbid usage of torrent software (even for legit, sharing reasons), how do you make sure you'll never be caught /by design/? At least you can prove you tried something to be compliant.

In this project I got a bit more acquainted to macOS architecture. Here I use a =plist= file to detect and react to some events.

## Polygam: choose as many spouses as you want (from Sep 2016)

https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan/polygam

Learning of logic programming with Clojure library core.logic. Given a tree of ancestors / descendants with some elicited vertices, what are all vertices that are elicited or descend from an elicited one?

## Open street map cartography (from March 2016)

Creation and integration of a hiking map layers and tracks for a 1500-km trail throughout France and Spain.

## Analysis of chess games (from Feb 2016)

https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan/PoC

Learning of logic programming with Clojure library core.logic, deepening my understanding of this language. PGF notation file parsing and discovery available legal moves. However, nothing to be compared to Alpha Zero ;-) Here I do nothing against combinatorial explosion so you can't actually predict all possible three-move-far positions because it would boil the ocean.

## Sinogram graph crawling (from Jul 2015)

https://github.com/piotr-yuxuan/chinese-huawen

- Functional programming with Clojure (JVM-based language)
- Formal grammars with instaparse.

This project is aimed at analysis of the sinogram set with graph and set theories. What’s the best way to learn and remember Chinese characters? Most of Chinese handbooks are built in a Western fashion: daily-life conversation samples bring new vocabulary and syntax examples. This fashion doesn’t take advantage of intrinsic Chinese language structure, which makes easier to discover 貴 when knowing yet中, 一 and 貝. 貴 stands for expensive or honourable while 貝 refers to shell or money. This semantic link lets it easy to remember both of them.

The first character 華 of the project name means sinity; 文 stands for language. The whole phrase 華文 means Chinese language and is readㄏㄨㄚˊ ㄨㄣˊ or huáwén.

This site has been in some extent redacted in French because part of this project is being developped whithin the frame of a school project.
